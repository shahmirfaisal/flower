        <p>A flower is the reproductive part of flowering plants. Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. Flowers
        have petals. Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds.</p>
    
        <h2>Structure of flowers</h2>

        <p>
            To investigate the structure of a flower, it must be dissected, and its structure summarised by a floral diagram or a
            floral formula. Then its family can be identified with the aid of a flora, which is a book designed to help you identify
            plants.

        <h3>Four basic parts</h3>
        <p>Flowers have four basic parts, from the outside in they are:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                The perianth, the vegetative parts
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The calyx: the outermost whorl consisting of units called sepals. These are often green and enclose the rest of the
                        flower in the bud. They may be absent, or they may be petal-like in some species
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The corolla: the petals, usually thin, soft and often colored to attract animals that help pollination
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                The reproductive parts
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The androecium, the male part, is the stamens
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The gynoecium, the female parts
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
